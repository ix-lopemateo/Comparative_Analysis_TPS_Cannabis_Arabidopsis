# Comparative_Analysis_TPS_Cannabis_Arabidopsis
This repository contains all files, scripts and results generated for the phylogenetic analysis of the terpene synthase (TPS) gene family in Cannabis sativa, using Arabidopsis thaliana as model reference species.

The objective of this project was to:

Identify TPS candidates in Cannabis sativa by homology.

Classify them into TPS subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-e/f).

Identify probable orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis thaliana.

Visualize and annotate the phylogenetic tree in a publication-ready format.
